  Movie Script as an additional text file when training our HMM (Hidden Markov Model).
- <strong>HMM\_additional\_spenser\_text.ipynb:</strong> Jupyter notebook incorporation the
  Spenser sonnets as an additional text file when training our HMM.
- <strong>HMM\_generation.ipynb:</strong> Jupyter notebook used to train a Hidden Markov Model 
  on Shakespearean sonnets and generate a 14-line sonnet.
- <strong>HMM\_with\_rhyme.ipynb:</strong> Jupyter notebook used to generate a 14-line sonnet 
  that follows the same rhyming scheme as a Shakespearean sonnet. 
- <strong>Preprocessing.ipynb:</strong> Jupyter notebook used to help preprocess the text file
  for all of Shakespeare's sonnets.
- <strong>RNN\_generation.ipynb:</strong> Jupyter notebook used to train a character-based LSTM
